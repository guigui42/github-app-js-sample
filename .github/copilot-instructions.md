This is a GitHub App sample that demonstrates how to use webhooks with a GitHub App's installation token to create a bot that responds to pull requests. The code is written in TypeScript and uses [octokit.js].
To be deployed using GitHub Actions, it requires Node.js 20 or higher and TypeScript 5.x.
Will be hosted on Azure Web Apps.
